    <p>
      For new Chinese speakers seeking native materials to engage with, the
      volume of media available can make difficult the process of finding works
      that suit their interests and taste. This is exacerbated by the fact that
      original works that grapple with their creators' environment often fall
      foul of censors, or are deterred from being created in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effort to engage is worthwhile. There are a wealth of contemporary
      artists and thinkers who convey deep human and social insights with
      dignity, humour, compassion and sorrow. In the case of those whose form of
      self-expression is hazardous, their willingness to continue regardless
      makes their voices especially deserving of an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The novelists, essayists, and filmmakers introduced below came via
      friends, other language learners, or chance encounters over years of
      searching. There are many more worth spending time with.

      Chen Zhongshi 陳忠實 (1942 - 2016) was an author and the 1997 recipient of
      the Mao Dun Literature Prize 茅盾文學獎.
    </p>
    <p>
      The novel that earned him recognition, White Deer Plain 白鹿原, follows
      two rival families in rural Shaanxi province through the major upheavals
      of the first half of the 20th century. From the decline of the Qing
      Dynasty, through the establishment of the Republic of China, Japanese
      occupation and civil war, and the ultimate victory of the Communist Party,
      Chen depicts the conflicting interests and obligations that lead
      individuals to fateful decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrative complexity brings out the overwhelming uncertainty people
      endured during the period, and avoids any sense of a simple moral path to
      safety.

      Yang Weidong 楊偉東 (1966 - ) is an artist and independent filmmaker.
      After suffering a politically-motivated family tragedy, he sought to
      understand how society could arrive at a state in which such acts occur
      without recourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is Put This On Record 立此存照, a multi-volume series of over
      500 interviews with prominent figures including officials, economists,
      historians, philosophers and activists across a spectrum of
      socio-political attitudes. Yang provides his subjects space to elucidate
      their thoughts, and humbly resists bringing his personal motivation into
      direct view.

      To Live 活著 follows the hubristic descent into poverty of the arrogant
      son of a land-owning family. As the events of civil war, famine, and the
      Cultural Revolution unfold, the protagonist emerges with a kinder outlook
      even under increasing isolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a study of an individual, To Live makes a good compliment to Chen
      Zhongshi's 陳忠實 broader take on similar themes from that era in White
      Deer Plain 白鹿原.

      His Outline of Chinese History 中國史綱 is an excellent introduction to
      ancient China, from the Xia dynasty through the Warring States period,
      unification under Qin Shihuang, and on to the establishment of the Eastern
      Han dynasty in the 1st century AD.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book is full of anecdotes on figures and events, and traces the
      emergence of China's philosophical schools, social customs, and political
      systems.
