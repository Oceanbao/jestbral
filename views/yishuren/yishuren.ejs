      For new Chinese speakers seeking native written and spoken materials to
      engage with, the volume of materials available can make difficult the
      process of locating works that suit their interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effort is worthwhile. There are a wealth of contemporary artists and
      thinkers who convey deep human and social insights with awe, humour, rage,
      and sorrow.

      The few novelists and essayists introduced below have come via

      encounters across years of searching. There are many more out there.

      Wang Shuo 王朔 (1958 - ) is a novelist and screenwriter. Known for his
      'hooligan' 流氓 style of writing, his works have been popular source
      material for film and television since the late 1980s.

    <p>
      The dark humour of Please Don't Call Me Human 千萬別把我當人 gets close to
      the bone with its absurdist ridicule of totalitarian bureaucracy.
      Published in the 1980s, a similar work could not evade censorship today.

      Wang Xiaobo 王小波 (1952 - 1997) was a novelist and essayist. Born in
      Beijing, he was amongst the many 'sent-down' or 'educated' youths 知識青年
      extracted from urban life to labour in rural areas during the Cultural
      Revolution 文革.
    </p>
    <p>
      That experience influenced some of his best-known works, including the
      satirical Golden Age 黃金時代. Essay collections such as Silent Majority
      沉默的大多數 exhibit his vernacular wit and talent for querying social
      norms.

    <p>
      Yang Weidong 楊偉東 (1966 - ) is an artist and independent filmmaker.
      After suffering a politically-motivated family tragedy, he sought to
      understand how society could arrive at a state in which such acts occur
      without recourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was Put This On Record 立此存照, a multi-volume series of over
      500 interviews with prominent figures including officials, economists,
      historians, philosophers and activists across a spectrum of
      socio-political attitudes. Yang provides his subjects space to elucidate
      their thoughts, and humbly resists bringing his personal motivation into
      direct view.
