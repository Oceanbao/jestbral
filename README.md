A long-term solo project to develop a personal website.

I'll test out code techniques as I learn them, to grow this into a website that combines multiple projects. Some projects will be for function, others for fun.

Current ideas include:

- Fund portfolio tracker
- RTS-style dynamic globe, that reveals places visited
- Family tree
- Intros to Chinese-language writers and artists
